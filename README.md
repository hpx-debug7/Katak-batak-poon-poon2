## 🔧 **Build & Deployment**

### **Creating a Release**
To create a distributable Windows Installer (`.exe`):

1.  Ensure all tests pass: `npm run test:testsprite`
2.  Run the packager:
    ```bash
    npm run package:client
    ```
3.  **Output**: Check the `dist/` folder for the setup executable (e.g., `Enterprise Lead Management System Setup 2.1.0.exe`).

### **Verification**
After building, verify the artifact integrity:
```bash
npm run verify:build
```

## 🧩 **Project Structure**

- `/app`: Next.js App Router pages and API routes.
- `/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `/lib`: Shared utilities, database clients, auth logic.
- `/prisma`: Database schema and migrations.
- `/electron`: Electron main process and preload scripts.
- `/e2e`: Playwright end-to-end test specs.

## 🛡️ **API Route Patterns**

All API routes use the `withApiHandler` wrapper for consistent middleware composition.

### **Declarative Permissions**

```typescript
import { PERMISSIONS } from '@/app/types/permissions';

export const GET = withApiHandler(
    { 
        authRequired: true, 
        permissions: [PERMISSIONS.LEADS_VIEW_ALL]
    },
    async (req, context) => { /* handler */ }
);
```

### **Permission Logic**

**OR Logic** (user needs ANY permission):
```typescript
permissions: [PERMISSIONS.LEADS_VIEW_OWN, PERMISSIONS.LEADS_VIEW_ALL],
requireAll: false
```

**AND Logic** (user needs ALL permissions):
```typescript
permissions: [PERMISSIONS.LEADS_EDIT, PERMISSIONS.LEADS_ASSIGN],
requireAll: true  // default
```

### **Special Options**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `skipTenantCheck: true` | For routes without tenant context (OAuth, auth) |
| `useApiKeyAuth: true` | Use API key authentication instead of session |

See `app/types/permissions.ts` for the complete list of available permissions.

## 🔑 **Default Credentials** (Dev/Test)


- **Admin User**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Export Password**: `admin123`

*> ⚠️ **Security Note**: Change these credentials immediately upon first deployment in a production environment.*

## 🤝 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1.  **"Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)**:
    - *Cause*: Unsigned installer (common for internal tools).
    - *Fix*: Click "More info" -> "Run anyway".

2.  **Excel Import Fails**:
    - *Fix*: Ensure the file is not password protected (unless using the specific secure import feature) and matches the CSV/XLSX template.

3.  **Database Locked**:
    - *Fix*: Close any open Prisma Studio instances or other processes accessing `dev.db`.
